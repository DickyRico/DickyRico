- 👋 Hi, I’m @DickyRico
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code for automation and embedded systems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 2, per the "Python The Hard Way" exhortations.  If I should be doing Py3 right away, let me know...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on control systems for some environmental 'safeguarding' systems (back-ups, hopefully little-used)
- 📫 How to reach me - via this hub, for now.
